<h2>
Stage 1: a fish
</h2>
<p>
The first stage of simulacra is a mirror of reality, we see a fish, we know its species, we know what it looks like, it's accurate to what a fish should look like and theres no meaning beside the one thats real.

<h2>
Stage 2: a bad fish
</h2>

<p>
The second stage of simulacra is a mirror of a mirror of reality, a mere drawing of a fish where we can recognize its a fish, its species, and preserves the nature of the fish, it maintains reality. However, it adds to reality, it adds an underlying meaning that isn't real.

<h2>
Stage 3: I think it's a fish
</h2>

<p>
The third stage of simulacra is a bit more complicated. While the second stage is a copy of reality, the third stage uses nostalgia. There is no longer the real, original fish, the third stage is a copy of nothing but pretends to be a copy of a fish. We can recognize the nature of the fish, but it's very meaning is lost since the real is lost as we try to mask the absence with this "fish"

<h2>
Stage 4: Swedish fish
</h2>

<p>
The fourth stage is simulacra itself. This is simulation that is it's very own reality, no longer a mere copy of reality, or a copy of a copy, or a facade covering up no reality, it is reality, or at least we think it is. No longer do we represent what a fish is, we merely take the idea of a fish and use it very whatever the hell we want. Just like how Disney Land forgoes reality for the fantastical imagery claiming the name of real, the Swedish fish discards the fish instead choosing a gelatinous sweet truth touching upon just the shape of what we think a fish is. Though the real idea of a fish is necessary for the new reality of the Swedish fish, it still creates its own truth, its own simulation of its own reality. This is simulacra.

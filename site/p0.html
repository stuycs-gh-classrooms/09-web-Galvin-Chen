    <h1>
      Moral Skep
    </h1>
    <p>
      Probably the easiest to understand form of skepticism. This is generally what people would think of when skepticism comes to mind, for by triggering moral skep you have failed to prove morality exists. It is clear to differentiate an ethic vs morality. An ethic is a notion or way to percieve while morality is an underlying premise to specifically guide action.

    <h1>
      Examples of Moral Skep
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The Place Paradox 
    </h2>
      
    </p>
    Very simple paradox, everything exists in a place, lets say Stuyvesant Highschool, but that place exists within another place, Manhattan, and that another place, New York City, then New York, United States, Earth, the Solar System, ect. Thus everything everywhere is really in the same place and thus the same thing and because of that there can never be any ought statements (morality) because those ought statements assume time-space continuum which the place paradox disproves.  
  <h2>
    Paradox of Tolerance
  </h2>
  <p>
    Another not too complicated paradox, in order to be completely open to an ought statement, meaning we are able to consider and discuss morality, we ought must exclude perspectives that are not open to the ought statement, which means we can never truly be open to ought statements which means we can never truly discuss morality which means morality doesn't exist.
  </p>
    <h2>
      Naturalistic Fallacy
    </h2>
    <p>
  Another fairly simple skep trigger, if we try to describe goodness on acts of goodness, then we can never truly know what goodness is because those acts of goodness have an infinite number of qualities that could define goodness meaning goodness can never truly have a definition and thus morality cannot exist. Okay think about the color yellow, we define yellow based on light vibrations and label that range yellow, but the actual perception of yellow is not the light vibrations its the experience of yellow that we call yellow. Applied to goodness the same question stands, if we define goodness on a physical phenomena then we ignore the actual experience of goodness which morality is supposed to be predicated on, and thus by triggering the naturalistic fallacy you fail to answer moral skep, meaning morality does not exist.

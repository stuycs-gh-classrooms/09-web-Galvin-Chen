    <h1>
      EXTERNAL SKEP
    </h1>
    <p>
      A simple form of skepticism, merely the question of whether or not the physical world exists. Physical world is a bit vague and gets refered to as many things, the phenomenal world, naturalistic world, machinist world, but they all mean generally the same thing, the world of physics where the movement of atoms and waves dictate things,

      Examples of External Skep

    <h2>
      Descartes Paradox
    </h2>
    <p>
      A very simple paradox contributing to the concept of empirical uncertainty, it proposes that an evil demon could be decieving us and thus all of our actions have no meaning, but you could imagine we're in a simulation or brain vats and it'll have the same ethical impact. If an evil demon was tricking us as it may just be controlling our actions through deception then any ethic based on our actions isn't reliable and thus that ethic is not reliable.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Bonini's paradox
    </h2>
    <p>
      A similarly simple paradox which states that any system whose purpose is to fully understand a complex system, like math, then that system will become so complex that we'll be unable to use it. This applies to external skep since ethics based on the external world inherently utilize systems that describe the external world which falls into Bonini's paradox and thus causes this system of ethics to be unreliable just like the system attempting to understand the external world.

    <h2>
      Grain Paradox
    </h2>
    <p>
      Personally one of my favorites, one grain of sand dropping makes no sound, but a thousand grains of sand makes a sound, but a thousand nothing cannot make something and thus the physical world is incoherent. You could replace grains of sand with something smaller if that makes more sense, but just in general this paradox makes zero sense.

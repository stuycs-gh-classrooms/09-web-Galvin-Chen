    <h1>
      LINGUISTIC SKEP
    </h1>
    <p>
      Out of the three, linguistic skep is probably the hardest one to grasp, but the bar is pretty low so. Linguistic skep is the question of if descriptive language is reliable, any ethic that relies on language that fails to answer linguistic skep is unreliable.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Examples of Linguistic Skep
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Paraconsistent logic 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Linguistic skep gets a bit hard to follow but this is fairly simple, start with two statements, contradictions are impossible, contradictions are possible, these two statements are contradictions yet we have also proven contradictions are true and thus a statement can be both true and false since we have proven statement one false but as a contradiction we have also proven it true. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Is-Ought Gap
    </h2>
    <p>
  This is a bit more simple than the last one, the Is-Ought Gap is the statement that descriptive claims cannot prescribe ought statements, just by saying "arsenic is poison" doesn't mean "one not ought to drink arsenic" and thus you can never describe an ought statement using descriptive language
    </p>
    <h2>
      Principle of Explosion
    </h2>
    <p>
      Going back to highschool geometry, lets propose a conditional statement, if p then q, this statement is only FALSE when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false, i.e if I say that if it is raining I have an umbrella, this is only false if it is raining and I don't have an umbrella. This meants that if the antecedent is false and the consequent is true the statement can still be true. All this concludes that you can prove anything true by merely switching out the first half of a disjunctive statement. If all lemons are yellow then unicorns are real, this statement is never false unless all lemons are yellow and unicorns aren't real, and since not all lemons are yellow unicorns have to be real since the statement given is only false in that one circumstance. This applied to ethics means any statement is true and thsu any ought statement is true meaning your ethics allow for anything to be morally justified.

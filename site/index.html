    <h2>
      Skepticism Briefly 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Skepticism as a term is used to describe plenty of concepts, but for now we'll view skepticism as merely the existence of doubt.
      We'll explore three types of skep, moral skep, external world skep, and linguistic skep, and although 
      we could go into the history behind the development of skeptical thought, the literature surrounding the topic, the numerous authors on this subject, 
      those websites exist already so we'll instead go over the application of skepticism through these three forms.
      
    </p>
      
      <h2>
        Skepticism Outweighs
      </h2>
    <p>
      Before we explain these three forms of skep, it's nice to first explain the signifigance of the concept overall. Skepticism is important because it is the 
      prior question to any form of ethics and the foundation to determine if an ethic is true in the first place. If an ethic cannot meet the questions
      or situations proposed by the skeptic, then the ethic "triggers" skep which dismantles the basis of which an ethic is founded upon. These skep triggers can be refered to as apriori, 
      which means they must be answered prior to any discussion pertaining or utilizing morality.

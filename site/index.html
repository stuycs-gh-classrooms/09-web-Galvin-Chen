      Skepticism Briefly 
    </h1>
    <p>
      I would like to preface this by saying I am by no means educated or even well versed in the topic discussed going foward, but that aside let us move foward. Skepticism as a term is used to describe plenty of concepts, but for this website we'll view skepticism as merely the existence of doubt. We'll explore three types of skep, moral skep, external world skep, and lingustic skep. Now we could go into the history behind the development of skeptical thought, the literature surrounding the topic, the numerous authors on this subject, but those websites exist already so we'll instead go over the application of skepticism.

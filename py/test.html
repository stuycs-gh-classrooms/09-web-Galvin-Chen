You open your eyes. You're in your bed. Your room is in disarray. Black garbage bags takes up most of the room on the floor, clothing rest on top of them. The desk by your bedside is filled with open ramen cups and empty energy drinks, your keyboard looks oily and your monitor has weird white stains on it. The entire room smells terrible but you don't seem to notice. There are no windows and you haven't bothered to fix the broken light. Go back to bed?
